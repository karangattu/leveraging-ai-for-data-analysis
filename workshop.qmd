**Definition:** The practice of designing effective prompts to get better AI responses

**Why It Matters:**

- Same question, different phrasings = different results
- Good prompts save time
- Better prompts = more accurate answers
- Essential skill for AI tools

---

## Principles of Good Prompts

**1. Be Specific**

❌ "Tell me about birds"
✅ "Explain the migration patterns of Arctic Terns, including timing and routes"

**2. Provide Context**

❌ "Analyze this data"
✅ "Analyze this bird census data from a temperate forest. The columns are: species, count, date, location"

---

## Principles of Good Prompts (cont.)

**3. Set Constraints**

❌ "How do I analyze diversity?"
✅ "Explain Shannon diversity index in 3 paragraphs suitable for undergraduate ecology students"

**4. Specify Format**

❌ "Compare these species"
✅ "Create a comparison table of these three warbler species, comparing habitat, diet, and migration"

---

## Advanced Prompt Techniques

**Role Assignment:**

"You are an expert ornithologist. Explain..."

**Step-by-Step Requests:**

"Walk me through the steps to calculate..."

**Examples in Prompts:**

"Like this example: [provide example], now do this with..."

**Follow-up Refinement:**

"That's good, but make it more concise"

---

## Common Prompt Mistakes

❌ **Too Vague:** "Help with my research"
✅ **Better:** "Suggest statistical methods for comparing bird abundance across 5 habitat types"

❌ **Assuming Too Much:** "Use the standard method"
✅ **Better:** "Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to..."

❌ **No Error Checking:** Accepting first answer
✅ **Better:** "Verify this answer: Is this the correct formula?"

---

## 🎯 Hands-On Task 2: Improve Your Prompts

**Exercise (10 minutes):**

**Part A:** First, copy this poor prompt into Gemini:
```
Tell me about bird diversity analysis
```

**Part B:** Now copy this improved version:
```
I'm an ornithologist studying songbird communities in 
temperate forests. Explain how to compare bird diversity 
between old-growth and secondary forests. Include which 
diversity metrics to use and why.
```

**Part C:** Create your own improved prompt for this vague question:
```
How do I analyze my data?
```

Your version should specify: data type, research question, sample size, and goal.

**Bonus:** Paste your improved prompts into Gemini and compare results!

**Share:** What made the difference in response quality?

---

## Domain-Specific Prompting

**For Ecology/Ornithology:**

Always include:

- **Study system:** "In temperate forest ecosystems..."
- **Scale:** "At the landscape scale..." / "For individual birds..."
- **Data type:** "Using point count data..." / "From GPS telemetry..."
- **Goal:** "To determine habitat preference..." / "To model population trends..."

**Example:**
"I have 5 years of point count data for breeding songbirds in oak-hickory forests. Suggest appropriate methods to analyze temporal trends in species richness."

# Section 4: Data Analysis with Gemini {.center background-color="#2C5F77"}

## Gemini for Data Analysis

**What Gemini Can Help With:**

- Understanding analysis methods
- Generating analysis code (R, Python)
- Interpreting results
- Creating visualizations
- Troubleshooting errors

**What It Cannot Do:**

- Run code for you (free tier)*
- Access your local files
- Make subjective research decisions

*Advanced paid features may allow code execution

---

## Workflow: Analysis with Gemini

**Typical Process:**

1. **Plan:** Ask Gemini for analysis strategy
2. **Code:** Request code for your analysis
3. **Interpret:** Paste results, ask for interpretation
4. **Refine:** Iterate based on feedback
5. **Visualize:** Get code for figures
6. **Document:** Generate result descriptions

**Key:** You're still in control! Gemini is your assistant.

---

## Example: Bird Diversity Analysis

**Your Question:**

"I have bird survey data with columns: site_id, species, count, habitat_type. I want to compare species diversity between forest and grassland habitats. Suggest an analysis approach."

**Gemini Might Suggest:**

1. Calculate diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson)
2. Test for differences (t-test or Mann-Whitney)
3. Visualize with boxplots
4. Consider sample size and rarefaction

---

## Generating R Code

**Your Prompt:**

"Write R code to calculate Shannon diversity index for each site from a dataframe called 'bird_data' with columns: site_id, species, count. Then compare diversity between habitats using a t-test."

**Gemini Will Generate:**

```r
library(vegan)
library(dplyr)

# Calculate Shannon diversity by site
diversity_by_site <- bird_data %>%
  group_by(site_id) %>%
  summarize(shannon = diversity(count, index = "shannon"))

# Merge with habitat data...
# Perform t-test...
```

---

## Generating Python Code

**Your Prompt:**

"Write Python code using pandas and scikit-bio to calculate Shannon diversity and create a boxplot comparing forest vs grassland sites."

**Gemini Will Generate:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from skbio.diversity import alpha_diversity
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate diversity
# Create visualization
# etc.
```

**Pro Tip:** Always specify libraries you prefer!

---

## Interpreting Results

**You Can Ask:**

- "What does a Shannon index of 2.3 mean?"
- "Is this p-value significant?"
- "Why might I see this pattern?"
- "What are alternative explanations?"

**Example Exchange:**

**You:** "I got a p-value of 0.23 comparing diversity between habitats. What does this mean?"

**Gemini:** "A p-value of 0.23 means there's no statistically significant difference (typically we use α=0.05). This suggests..."

---

## Working with Actual Data

**Best Practices:**

1. **Don't share sensitive data:** Use fake/anonymized examples
2. **Describe structure:** Column names, data types
3. **Show small samples:** First few rows as example
4. **Specify format:** CSV, Excel, database, etc.

**Example:**

"I have a CSV with these columns and first 3 rows:
```
species,count,site
RWBL,5,A1
AMRO,3,A1
NOCA,2,A2
```
..."

---

## 🎯 Hands-On Task 3: Analyze Sample Data

**Exercise (15 minutes):**

**Copy this complete scenario into Gemini:**

```
I have bird survey data from 10 sites. Here are the results:

Forest sites:
- Site F1: 12 species, 45 total birds, Shannon diversity = 2.21
- Site F2: 15 species, 52 total birds, Shannon diversity = 2.48
- Site F3: 14 species, 48 total birds, Shannon diversity = 2.35
- Site F4: 13 species, 50 total birds, Shannon diversity = 2.28
- Site F5: 16 species, 55 total birds, Shannon diversity = 2.52

Grassland sites:
- Site G1: 8 species, 38 total birds, Shannon diversity = 1.85
- Site G2: 10 species, 41 total birds, Shannon diversity = 1.98
- Site G3: 9 species, 39 total birds, Shannon diversity = 1.91
- Site G4: 11 species, 43 total birds, Shannon diversity = 2.05
- Site G5: 7 species, 35 total birds, Shannon diversity = 1.76

Questions:
1. Calculate the mean Shannon diversity for each habitat type
2. Does there appear to be a difference between habitats?
3. Would a t-test be appropriate here? Why or why not?
4. What would be the null and alternative hypotheses?
5. What biological factors might explain any differences?
```

**Then try follow-up questions:**
- "Write R code to perform this analysis"
- "How would I visualize these results?"
- "What if the data isn't normally distributed?"

---

## Common Data Analysis Requests

**Statistical Tests:**

- "Which test should I use for..."
- "Explain assumptions of ANOVA"
- "Write code for a mixed effects model"

**Visualization:**

- "Create a ggplot for..."
- "Make a matplotlib figure showing..."
- "Suggest effective visualizations for..."

**Interpretation:**

- "What does this coefficient mean?"
- "Explain this interaction effect"
- "Is this effect size meaningful?"

**Option A - Species Identification:**
```
I observed a small songbird in a temperate forest with these 
characteristics:
- Size: smaller than a robin
- Upperparts: olive-brown
- Underparts: white with brown streaking
- Behavior: foraging on the ground, scratching in leaf litter
- Song: loud, clear "tea-CHER, tea-CHER, tea-CHER"

What species might this be? Provide a shortlist of possibilities 
and key distinguishing features. I'm in the northeastern US.
```

**Option B - Research Design:**
```
I want to study the effect of forest fragmentation on songbird 
nesting success. I have access to 20 forest fragments ranging 
from 5 to 100 hectares and one breeding season to collect data.

Help me design this study:
1. How should I allocate my effort?
2. What variables should I measure?
3. What are potential confounding factors?
4. What statistical approach would I use?
5. What are the main limitations?
```

**Option C - Writing Help:**
```
Help me write a methods paragraph. I conducted point count 
surveys at 30 sites (15 forest, 15 grassland). Each site was 
surveyed 3 times between May 15 and June 30, 2024. Each survey 
lasted 10 minutes. I recorded all birds seen or heard within 
50m radius between 6am-10am on days with no rain and wind <15 km/h.

Write this as a clear methods paragraph for a scientific paper.
